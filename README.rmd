# sfpu (Stuff For Personal Usage)

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

## Overview

The aim of this package to gather most of relevant, useful, repetitive functions and datasets in one place. So the scope is:

- simplified shapefiles of Poland, on different level 
- calculated shortest paths between points in graph (i.e. distance between centers of polygons based on neighbourhood, not proximity)
- functions for generatvie art projects
- etc.

## Usage

`library(sfpu)` will load the most useful packages: 

- data.table
- ggplot2
- magrittr

and give access to some prepared datasets:

- simplified shapefiles of Poland
- neighbourhood
- precalcutaed distances based on Djikstra algorithm

## Packages

- [data.table](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table), for manipulating data.
- [ggplot2](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2), for graphics.
- [magrittr](https://github.com/tidyverse/magrittr), for pipe.

## To do

- replace magrittr pipe for native R pipe
- add tests to every function
- unify naming of functions and arguments
- add comments in both English and Polish
- use github actions for learning purposes
