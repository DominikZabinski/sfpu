## Overview

The aim of this package to gather most of relevant, useful, repetitive functions and datasets in one place. So the scope of this package is:

- simplified shapefiles of Poland, at different administrative levels 
- calculated shortest paths between points in graph (i.e. distance between centers of polygons based on neighbourhood, not proximity)
- functions for generatvie art projects
- etc.

## Usage

`library(sfpu)` will load the most useful packages: 

- data.table;
- ggplot2;
- sf;
- stringr.

and give access to some prepared datasets:

- simplified shapefiles of Poland
- neighbourhood
- precalcutaed distances based on Djikstra algorithm ([R implementation](https://blog.ephorie.de/finding-the-shortest-path-with-dijkstras-algorithm), [Wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm))

## Packages

- [data.table](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table) for manipulating data;
- [ggplot2](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2) for graphics;
- [magrittr](https://github.com/tidyverse/magrittr) for pipe;
- [stringr](https://github.com/tidyverse/stringr) for string manipulation;
- [sf](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf) for simple features of spatial data.

## GitHub Actions

For learning purposes this package is using GitHub Actions. Great post about GitHub Actions can be found here: [Monitoring quarto-dev repositories: Creating a workflow with GitHub Actions for R users](https://beamilz.com/posts/series-gha/2022-series-gha-2-creating-your-first-action/en/)
